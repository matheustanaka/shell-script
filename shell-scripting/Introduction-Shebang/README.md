# First class - Introduction & Shebang

First class we covered how to create a simple script with shell.
And we learned how to define our interpreter:

- Before start coding, you should define your interpreter, there are so many interpreter but here we will use bash.

- You should type in the first line **#!/bin/bash** to define bash your interpreter.

### Running the command

After that, you need to open the terminal and type **chmod +x** to give permission, so the **x** is used to add permission to execute.
Now it's time to run your script, so just type ./simple.sh in your terminal and you will see what happens.
