# Second Class - Varibales

### First Rule
When you create your variable, you can't use spaces and they should be in uppercase. Ex:
- NAME="Matheus"

### Second Rule
You need to use curly braces to concat with the rest of text.
Ex:
- echo "The most popular sport is ${SPORT}ball".
- OUTPUT: "The most popular sport is football"

### Third Rule
You can't initialize variables with numbers. Ex:
- 01_STUDENT is the wrong way
- STUDENT_01="Jorge" is correct
